## Birthday Greetings

As youâ€™re a very friendly person, you would like to send a birthday note to all friends that you have. But you have a lot of friends and you are a bit lazy, it may take some time to write all the notes by hand.

The good news is that computers can do it automatically for you.

Imagine you have a flat file with all your friends :


**last_name, first_name, date_of_birth, email**
```
Doe, John, 1982/10/08, <john.doe@foobar.com>
Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, <mary.ann@foobar.com>
```

And you want to send them a happy birthday email on their birthday:

_Subject: Happy birthday!_

_Happy birthday, dear &lt;first_name&gt;!_

Implement a solution that sends the message to the friends that have a birthday today.
